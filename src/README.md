## Discord DotaBot

This is sort of a proof of concept bot allowing players in the channel to add or remove themselves from a list of players,
display links to their last match, and capture the current players in a lobby joined (at the start of the match) and display
links to those profiles.
```
 !lm 
 !players 
 !add
 !delete
 !capture
 !help
```
